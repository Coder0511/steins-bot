**About Music Commands:**

I accept YouTube videos, playlists and shorts (including age restricted videos). I'm also compatible with Spotify, YouTubeMusic and Deezer.

`%play` or `%p` ---> play any music, video or podcast you want!! If you use it without a link it will pause or resume the current song.

You can also search with words like `%play the only thing I know for real`

`%loop` ---> Loops the track that's currently playing or the whole queue. You can actually do:
- `%loop` or `%loop track` to loop the currently playing track
- `%loop queue` or `%loop q` or `%loop all` to loop the whole queue
- `%loop off` or `%loop disable` to get out of the loop
- Skipping a track with `%sk` will take you out of the loop

`%pause` ---> pause the song

`%resume` ---> resume the song

`%skip` or `%sk` ---> skip the song

`%replay` or `%reset` or `%restart` ---> restarts the current song

`%ff (seconds)` or `%fastforward (seconds)` ---> fast forward the amount of seconds you want

`%gb (seconds)` or `%goback (seconds)` ---> rewind the amount of seconds you want

`%seek (minute)` or `%tp (minute)` or `%goto (minute)` ---> go to a specific minute of the video

You can write it like 03:07, 3:07 or even 3:7, but for videos longer than one hour it will only work 01:03:07 or 1:03:07

`%queue` or `%q` ---> show all the songs in the queue

`%clear` or `%cl` or `%cls` ---> clear the whole queue

`%shuffle` ---> shuffle the queue

`%rm (number)` or `%remove (number)` ---> remove a song from the queue writing the command and the position of the song in the queue. If you don't write anything, the last one in the queue will be removed

`%stop` ---> stop playing music

`%np` or `%nowplaying` ---> show info about the current song

`%length` ---> check the current time of the track that's being played and its length

`%move (song position) (new position)` ---> move a song in the queue from one position to the desired one. For example, writing `%move 2 7` moves a song from position 2 to 7 in the queue

`%search (title)` ---> can't find what you're looking for? Type the title and I'll show you five results. Then react with the emoji of the song you want to select :)
