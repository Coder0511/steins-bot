Hi, this is a Discord bot that I made for a server of a YouTuber with (as of 2025) almost 100K subscribers.

Some of the features include a music player. It also sends GIFs, images and more (please check `help.py` file for more details).

`Disclaimer`: this bot is already deprecated and I programmed it years ago before actually getting hired and becoming a software developer, so expect problems like non-descriptive variables, lack of comments and non-efficient code.

Thanks for your patience.

Sorry, I don't remember the versions of the depencies so I won't specify them in the `requirements.txt` file
